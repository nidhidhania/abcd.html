<p>Perhaps an adversary has just challenged you to a steeple chase run, or maybe you need a fast, and practical mode of transportation as you are pursuing an enemy’s plane down a dirt runway. Or, better yet, one of the most beautiful women you have ever seen has just come riding up the beach on horseback. Whether your needs are pragmatic or romantic, this one skill will serve them both, so you had better be ready and skilled in the art of horseback riding. Horseback riding is one of the most unique experiences you will ever have. Consider the fact that horseback riding is an activity that you never do alone; it is always you and the horse. This is a huge, thinking, breathing creature, and unlike other skills or activities where you are simply relying on your own skills and knowledge, in this situation the horse might have something to say about it too.</p>

<P><i><b>&QUOT;It’s important to establish good relationships with the horse&QUOT;</b></i> from the get go. Horses can smell a beginner, they know when a rider doesn’t know what he or she is doing and if you are not comfortable with the horse, the horse might not be comfortable with you.</P>

<P>It’s always a good idea to walk up to the horse, pat the horse, and take a second to become a little bit acquainted. One interesting thing to keep in mind is that like all plant eaters, horses have their eyes on the side of their heads not on the front; it will typically move its head slightly back and forth so it can actually look ahead from a side view. The rider can’t just sit back and let the horse do the work. The horse doesn’t know when the obstacle is right in front, and this maneuver will require the rider and the horse to work together. But for now, it’s just good to know that the horse can see you best from the side, so as you move around the horse be aware that the horse wants to know where you are. You may want to get to know the horse, but the horse might not want to get to know you. </P>

<P>When it comes time to mount the horse, you want to mount up the horse from the left. <i><b>Why is that?</b></i> Ever since the days when men were wearing swords on their left sides, they have been mounting the horse from the left, so to this day, horses are used to being mounted from the left.</P>

	<LI>You use a combination of the reins and your legs to communicate commands to the horse. You move in the direction you want to go by pulling the reins to the left to tell the horse to go left, and you pull the reins to the right to tell the horse to go right. You also use the reins to stop the horse by simply pulling the reins towards you. You don’t need to apply much pressure.</LI>
	<br>
	<LI>The correct way to hold the reins is to grab them from the outside, so that you can see the top of your hands. The reins are going from the outside of your hands, from your pinkie area, toward the mouth of the horse, and you grab it in a spot where you take in the slack. When your forearms are rested in your lap, the slack that goes from your hands to the horse’s mouth should be taught. A simple dip in your hand gesture will apply a moderately gentle pressure on the horse’s mouth, signaling your command to the horse to go either right or left.</LI>
	<br>
	<LI>You shouldn’t have to pull with your arms at all; just this slight change in pressure with the flick of your wrist should be all the horse needs to understand your command.</LI>
	<br>
	<LI>The same goes for stopping a horse. Applying pressure with both wrists will signal to the horse that it’s time to stop. Gentle pressure with a backwards motion with your hands is all you need. Hold that pressure until the horse has obeyed your command, and has come to a complete stop. You should do this in a motion that is gentle but firm.</LI>
	<br>
	<LI>To make the horse go, you use your legs. Squeeze gently, or bump your heels, to ask the horse to move forward, and as soon as the horse responds and starts forward, stop kicking and remain conscious of your leg movement. Be conscious of what your legs are doing because your legs are communicating to the horse.</LI>
